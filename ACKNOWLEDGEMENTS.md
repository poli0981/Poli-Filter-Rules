# Acknowledgements

This project wouldn't be possible without the following contributions and inspirations:

## Core Development
- **Solo Developer (@poli0981)**: As the primary creator, handled prompt engineering, writing and updating rules, testing, and overall project management. This accounts for approximately 50% of the effort.
- **Grok 4 (by xAI)**: Provided AI assistance for the remaining 50%, including:
  - Drafting documentation (e.g., README, Acknowledgements, Disclaimer).
  - Guiding rule creation and syntax.
  - Searching for information, basic rules, and web references.
  - Suggesting code snippets and troubleshooting ideas.

The collaboration was a balanced 50/50 split, making this a hybrid human-AI project.

## Inspirations and Sources
- **Community Filter Lists**: Drew inspiration from open-source projects like [EasyList](https://easylist.to/), [uBlock Origin Filters](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets), and [AdGuard Filters](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters). Some basic rules were adapted or referenced from these.
- **AdBlock Plus Documentation**: For filter syntax guidelines.
- **GitHub Community**: For best practices in repo structure and licensing.

Special thanks to the open-source adblocking community for making the web a better place. If you've contributed indirectly (e.g., via referenced rules), feel free to open an issue to be added here!
