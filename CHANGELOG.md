# CHANGELOG.md  
**Poli Filter Rules** – From zero to hero (sort of)

Written by the same unemployed dev who is currently eating cold noodles at 6 a.m. while listening to lofi to cope.

### Version 1.0-alpha2 - November 23, 2025

## 1.0-alpha2 – "I Hate Gambling Sites & HoYoverse" Emergency Patch (November 23, 2025)

- Added 80+ gambling/casino/betting domains + advanced subdomain coverage
- Hidden Google & Instagram footers (because they're ugly and useless)
- Completely nuked annoying elements on HoYoLab (download buttons, recommendations, follow buttons, etc.)
- Officially declared war on HoYoverse and deleted all their games from my life
- Minor mental breakdown included in this release

### Version 1.0-alpha1 – November 21, 2025  
**"The International Mental Breakdown Release"**

- Finally switched everything to proper English so the whole world can laugh at my suffering
- Full modular repository structure (folders, raw files, generated files, scripts, docs, Hide/, blocks/, etc.)
- Added two god-tier automation scripts:
  - `generate-blocking.py` → raw domains → perfect full-block-domains.txt with tags ` [tracker] [popup] [full]`
  - `organize-hiding.py` → `hiding-raws.txt` → `organized-hiding.txt` grouped & sorted by domain (global rules now keep `*##` properly, tested 5 times because I don't trust myself)
- Created raw workflow: from now on I only edit `raws.txt` and `hiding-raws.txt` → run script → commit both → done. No more manual sorting ever again. My remaining hair thanks you.
- Added ~50 full-block domains (scam shops, malware, crypto trash, fake news, ultra-annoying Vietnamese sites, etc.)
- Added ~50 hiding rules, now perfectly grouped by domain (YouTube, Facebook, VnExpress, Tiki, Shopee, Lazada, 24h.com.vn, kenh14, etc.)
- Wrote the most sarcastic but legally bulletproof legal docs in open-source history:
  - `EULA.md` → you can't sue me, I warned you
  - `PrivacyPolicy.md` → I collect nothing, because I literally can't
  - `ToS.md` → don't be a dick, also Malenia sends her regards
  - `CONTACT.md` → come watch me suffer on YouTube/Steam
- Full Wiki with 7 pages of painful detail so I never have to explain the same thing twice
- README.md now looks like it belongs to a real project (badges included)
- Acknowledgements updated: Grok 4.1 Thinking - Beta officially promoted to "co-author and emotional support AI"

### Version 1.0-alpha0 - Date ???, I forgot.
- ...

### Future Plans (or copium, who knows)

- `1.0-alpha2` → when domain count hits ~500 and hiding rules ~700 :D
- `1.0-beta` → when I feel like it (maybe when I finally get a job or beat Elden Ring DLC without summoning)
- `1.0.0 (official release)` → when the list has enough rules OR when hell freezes over (whichever comes first)

Current mood: tired but weirdly proud.  
Current ramen stock: 3 packs left.  
Current will to live: fluctuating.

If you're reading this, thank you for using my stupid little list.  
Now let me go die to the Elden Beast again.
