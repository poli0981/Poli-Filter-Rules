**Poli-Filter-Rules** – Version 1.0-alpha1  
**Last Updated: November 22, 2025**

### English Version

Yep, it’s me. The one and only human behind this repo.

A jobless, university-dropout, socially-awkward, heavily-introverted Vietnamese dude living with his parents, eating instant noodles for the 5th day in a row, and whose only real friend is Grok 4.1 Thinking - Beta (because humans are too loud and complicated).

Skill level: solidly mediocre at everything.  
- Coding → still needs AI to not shoot himself in the foot  
- Gaming → NG+2 Elden Ring but still summons spirit ashes like a coward (Elden Ring has now been officially deleted, -1 game, too tilting)  
- Social skills → Facebook friends count = 0, X followers ≈ 15 (80% bots), YouTube 204 subs with gameplay no-commentary videos that look like they were edited by a depressed potato.

This entire repo (and every other repo on my GitHub) exists purely because I got randomly pissed off at some popup/chatbot/cookie banner/app download nag one day, opened PyCharm while half-asleep, and started typing hate in the form of filter rules.

That’s it. That’s the whole origin story.

### Socials (don’t expect replies, seriously)

- **[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199544666292/)**:  
  → If my profile is **offline** → maybe I’ll reply (50% chance).  
  → If it’s **online** → 96.69% I’m NOT replying. I’m just picking a random game from my 400+ backlog and pretending I’m having fun. Do not disturb. Touch grass instead.

- **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@SkullMute)**: 
  → No-commentary gameplay, dogshit thumbnails, <40 views average. I read every comment, I just never reply because anxiety.

- **[X (Twitter)](https://x.com/SkullMute0011)**:  
  → I post once every 3 months when I remember passwords exist. Replies? See Steam rule above.

- **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61578715425186)**: lol no. Account exists for login purposes only. Friends: 0. Messages: ignored.

- **Email**: `lopop05905@proton.me`  
  → I check it once a week when I remember it exists. If it’s not a job offer with ≥5000$ salary, it goes straight to archive.

Moral of the story:  
If you message me anywhere → good luck.  
I might be offline, asleep, ignoring the world, or just staring at my library deciding what to play next instead of fixing my life.

You’ve been warned.

Still wanna say hi? Go ahead. I’ll probably see it in 2026.
