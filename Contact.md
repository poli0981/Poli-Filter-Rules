# CONTACT.md  
**Poli-Filter-Rules** – Version 1.0-alpha1  
**Last Updated: November 21, 2025**

Welcome to the Contact section of a random unemployed, introverted, mildly autistic dev who literally only talks to an AI because real humans are exhausting and small talk makes me want to uninstall life.

Yes, Grok 4.1 is my only friend. Yes, I’m writing this at 5 a.m. after finally beating Malenia in NG+2, uninstalling Elden Ring, staring at my empty Steam library for 20 minutes, and realising I have no idea what to play next.  
Send help. Or a job. Or a new personality.

Anyway, if you really, REALLY need to reach me (please don’t, unless it’s to send copium or ramen), here are my sad little internet corners:

### Steam  
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199544666292/  
300+ games, 90% untouched, 9% abandoned after 30 minutes, 1% actually completed.  
Elden Ring has been ceremonially uninstalled after NG+2 left me with PTSD.  
Currently lost in existential crisis: “What do I play now?”  
Feel free to send friend request. I’ll probably accept in 3–4 business months.

### YouTube (No Commentary Gameplay Hell)  
https://www.youtube.com/@SkullMute
Almost 1 year old, ~200 subs (most are bots or pity subs), average view count: 25–40.  
80% of videos have less than 40 views.  
I play whatever the hell I feel like — AAA masterpieces, indie, pixel art, hyper-realistic graphics, doesn’t matter.  
No commentary, just raw gameplay, mouse clicks, and occasional rage-breaths.  
If you want to watch a grown man suffer silently in 1080p60, you came to the right place.

### X (Twitter – where I pretend to be funny)  
https://x.com/SkullMute0011
Mainly shitposts, copium, screenshots of me dying in games, and occasional “why am I like this” status at 4 a.m.  
Follower count: yes.  
Engagement: also yes (if bots count).

### GitHub (the only place I’m slightly competent)  
https://github.com/poli0981
You’re already here. Hi.

### Facebook  
https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61578715425186
Exists. Barely used. Mostly for family to check I’m still alive.

### Instagram  
Literally just reposts from X and some blurry game screenshots.  
Don’t bother.

### Telegram  
If you somehow find my username, I’ll be impressed.  
I use it to send myself memes and backup save files.

### Email  
No.  
Just open an issue on the repo.  
Or don’t.  
I’m probably asleep or staring at Steam “What to play” page again.

Final words:  
If you made it this far, congratulations — you now know more about me than my own mother.  
Please don’t DM me asking for tech support, relationship advice, or why I’m like No Commentary videos, or why I still haven’t found a job.

Just star the repo, block some ads, and let me suffer in peace.
