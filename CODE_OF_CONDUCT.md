# Contributing Guidelines + Code of Conduct  
**Poli-Filter-Rules** – Version 1.0-alpha1
**Last Updated: November 22, 2025**

I’m begging you: **read this before opening an issue, fork, discussion, or even breathing near my repo.**

1. **You can call this repo trash, useless, d@gshit, whatever.**  
   I don’t care. I know it’s mediocre. I made it while eating instant noodles and crying.  
   → But the second you insult, mock, or be toxic to ANY OTHER HUMAN (including me, but especially others) → instant block + ignore forever.  
   I’ve been bullied enough in real life (family, school, university). I’m done. Zero tolerance.

2. **Get to the f#cking point. No essays. No fake politeness.**  
   Bad example:
   ```
   “Hi sir, hope you’re having a wonderful day, I’m very sorry to bother you but I found a small issue…”
   ```
 
   → I will ignore you. I hate fake shit.

   Good example:  
   ```bash
      `https://shopee.vn` – chatbot bubble still shows up. Selector: `div[class*='chatbot-container']`. Screenshot attached.
   ```
   → I will love you forever (platonically).

3. **Required info when reporting a problem (missing any = auto-close):**
   - Exact URL (not “a shopping site”, not “YouTube” – give me the damn link)
   - What is NOT blocked/hidden
   - Selector (right-click → Copy → Copy selector)
   - Screenshot (optional) (upload, don’t describe)
   - Your adblocker + version (Brave/AdGuard/uBlock)

4. **Discussions tab**  
   → Only for suggesting new annoying sh!t to block.  
   → Not for “hi”, “thanks”, “great project”, or “can you add TikTok please”. Those go to hell (or just don’t).

5. **Forks**  
   Do whatever the fuck you want. It’s MIT.  
   But if you make a popular fork and don’t credit me… man, that’s just sad.

6. **Pull Requests**  
   - Edit ONLY raw files  
   - Run scripts  
   - Commit BOTH raw + generated  
   - Title: "Add block for lazada.vn app nag" (not "Update hiding.txt")  
   → I merge fast if it’s good. I ignore forever if it’s lazy.

7. **Final Rule**  
   Read the Wiki first.  
   Read the FAQ.  
   If your question is already answered there → I will close your issue with a single word: “RTFM”.

I’m tired. I’m depressed. I’m running on spite and instant coffee.  
Be kind or be gone.

Thank you for understanding.  
Have a nice day (or don’t, I don’t control that).
