# Code of Conduct

**Poli Filter Rules** – Version 1.0  
**Last Updated: January 2, 2026**

Repo's 1.0 now – from solo spite to "official" (still me + AI, no corp). We keep it welcoming for everyone: Devs, noobs, lurkers, that one star-giver. Beta growth taught chill – let's stay positive, direct, drama-free.

## Pledge

Harassment-free for all – age, size, disability, ethnicity, gender, experience, education, status, nationality, appearance, race, religion, orientation. Different views welcome (even "this sucks" – fair). Toxicity? Out.

## Standards

**Do:**
- Respect/neutral (or tired like me :v).
- Assume good intent – we're fighting ads + life.
- Critique code/ideas, not people ("Rule bloaty" > "You dumb").
- Direct language (fake nice? I hate that too).

**Don't:**
- Insult/harass/dox anyone (zero tolerance – block forever).
- Spam off-topic (Wiki/FAQ first or RTFM :v).
- Toxic to others (trash me/project? OK, I'm numb. Others? Rethink life, kindly).

## Enforcement

My call (Grok helps code, not drama):
- Mild: Reminder/edit.
- Serious: Block/close – no mercy.
- Appeals? Email [here](mailto:coding201913@hotmail.com) – expect "read CoC".

Inclusivity goal, but exhausting = gone. 1.0's mature – keep fun.

## Attribution

Adapted from Contributor Covenant – thanks blueprint. Real for tired dev repo.

Questions? Issues (politely). Thanks for being cool(ish).

– The dev enforcing this on coffee + regrets :))
