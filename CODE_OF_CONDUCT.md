# Code of Conduct

**Poli-Filter-Rules**  
**Last Updated: November 26, 2025**

This repo is a solo + AI project born from frustration and late-night caffeine – it's not perfect, but it's ours. We keep it welcoming for everyone: devs, noobs, lurkers, and that one person who actually stars it. Beta means we're growing up, so let's keep the vibe positive, direct, and drama-free.

## Our Pledge

We commit to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We value different opinions and perspectives – even if they're "this repo is trash" (hey, fair). But toxicity? Nah. We're here to clean the web, not each other's feeds.

## Standards of Conduct

**Do:**
- Be respectful and kind (or at least neutral – I'm tired too).
- Assume good intent – we're all fighting ads and existential dread.
- Critique ideas/code, not people (e.g., "This rule's bloaty" > "You're dumb").
- Use clear, direct language (no fake politeness – I hate that too).

**Don't:**
- Insult, harass, or dox anyone (zero tolerance – block + ignore forever).
- Spam issues/PRs with off-topic rants (Wiki/FAQ first, or gentle RTFM).
- Be toxic to others (trash the project/me? OK, I'm numb. Trash someone else? Rethink your life, kindly).

## Enforcement

Violations? I'll handle 'em solo-style:
- Mild: Gentle reminder + edit/delete.
- Serious: Block, close issues, no mercy.
- Enforcement is up to me (Grok helps debug, not drama). Appeals? Email [lopop05905@proton.me] – but expect "read CoC again."

We aim for inclusivity, but if it's exhausting, it's out. Beta's about growth – let's make it fun.

## Attribution

Adapted from Contributor Covenant v2.1 – thanks for the blueprint. Made real for a tired dev's repo.

Questions? Issues open (politely). Thanks for being awesome(ish).
