**Custom Adblock Filter List** – Version 1.0  
**Last Updated: January 2, 2026**

This repository and its contents are provided **"AS IS"** without warranty of any kind, express or implied – including merchantability, fitness for purpose, or non-infringement. 1.0 means we've survived alpha chaos and beta tweaks, but "stable" is relative when coded by a tired, unemployed dev on instant noodles and spite.

## Key Warnings (Read or Regret – Seriously)

- **Official But Still Human**: 1.0 is the "good enough" milestone – rules leaner, scripts smarter, docs polished. But websites evolve faster than my motivation. Rules may over-block, under-block, or glitch when sites redesign.
- **Personal Origins**: Born from one guy's (mine) daily rage at ads, trackers, popups, and cookie nags. Not universal – what I hate might be your must-have. Customize, fork, or whitelist – don't blame me if your fave site turns skeleton.
- **Potential Breakage (It Happens)**:
  - Legit elements (logins, payments, footers) hidden/blocked – test non-critical first.
  - Conflicts with other lists – disable to debug.
  - Wildcard rules powerful but risky – over-nuke? Exception time.
- **No Liability, Empty Wallet Edition**: I'm broke, jobless, laptop wheezing. Zero responsibility for damages, data loss, site breakage, or "therapy bills from cleaner internet." Sue? Win my Steam backlog (400+ sale games of regret).
- **Update Rhythm**: ~3–5 days when life allows (health, scams, noodle runs). No SLAs – check commits.
- **Third-Party Roots**: Rules inspired by EasyList, uBlock, AdGuard, Dandelion Sprout's gems (wildcard wisdom saved my sanity). Conflicts? Your merge puzzle.
- **Privacy & Security Note**: Filters help dodge trackers – not bulletproof. Pair with VPNs/antivirus. No complete protection promise.

You're responsible for testing, tweaking, using wisely. Fork if breaks – open-source magic.

By using, you accept all risks. No take-backs.
