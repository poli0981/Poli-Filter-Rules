Version 1.0.0-beta0 means we're past alpha chaos, but beta still means "test at your own risk" – expect refinements, not perfection.

## Key Warnings (Read This or Regret It)

- **Beta Stage Evolution**: This is 1.0.0-beta0. We've cleaned up scripts, optimized rules, and polished docs, but things can still break. Websites change faster than I can caffeinate. Rules may over-block, under-block, or glitch on edge cases.
- **Personal Project Roots**: These filters are born from one dude's (mine) daily battles with ads, trackers, popups, and existential dread. They're not universal – what annoys me might be your lifeline. Customize or fork; don't blame me if your favorite site looks like a skeleton.
- **Potential Side Effects (They Happen)**:
  - Legit elements (footers, logins, buttons) get hidden or blocked – test on non-critical tabs first.
  - Adblockers might conflict with other lists; disable 'em temporarily to debug.
  - Over-aggressive wildcard rules (e.g., *.com) could nuke too much – whitelist exceptions as needed.
- **No Liability, Zero Dollars Edition**: I'm broke, jobless, and my most valuable asset is a wheezing laptop. I disclaim all liability for damages, data loss, site breakage, or therapy bills from a "cleaner" internet. If you sue and win, congrats – you get my Steam backlog (400+ games of regret).
- **Update Cadence**: Roughly every 3–5 days, but life (health, scams, noodle runs) gets in the way. No SLAs here – check commits for changes.
- **Third-Party Inspirations**: Rules draw from EasyList, uBlock, AdGuard, and gems like Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List (shoutout for the wildcard wisdom – learned the hard way). Conflicts? Your problem to sort.
- **Privacy & Security Reminder**: These filters help dodge trackers, but they're no silver bullet. Pair with VPNs, antivirus, and common sense. No guarantees against malware or Big Brother.

You're responsible for testing, tweaking, and using wisely. If it breaks, fork it – that's open-source magic.

By using this repo, you accept all risks. No take-backs.
