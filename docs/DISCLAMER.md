## Key Warnings

- **Early Development Stage**: This is version **1.0-alpha1**. The list is still evolving rapidly. Rules may be incomplete, overly aggressive, or cause website breakage, or become outdated when sites change their layout/scripts.
- **Personal Project**: These filters reflect one person's browsing habits and annoyances. They are **not** intended as a universal solution and may hide or block content that you consider useful or necessary.
- **Potential Side Effects**:
  - Legitimate page elements (footers, login forms, paywalls, etc.) may be hidden or blocked.
  - Some sites may detect adblocking and refuse to load properly.
  - Over-blocking can occur – always test thoroughly.
- **No Liability**: The author(s) shall not be held liable for any damages, loss of functionality, or issues arising from the use or inability to use these filters, including but not limited to broken websites, lost content, or any other direct or indirect consequences.
- **Update Frequency**: The list is updated approximately every 3–5 days. Delays may occur due to health issues, lost files, real-life commitments, or lack of motivation. There is no guaranteed schedule.
- **Third-Party Content**: Some rules are inspired by or adapted from public filter lists (EasyList, uBlock filters, etc.). Compatibility with other lists is not guaranteed and conflicts may arise.
- **Privacy & Security**: While the goal is to enhance privacy, these filters do **not** provide complete protection against tracking or malware. Combine with other tools (VPN, antivirus, etc.) for better security.
- **Legal Note:** Ensure compliance with local laws when blocking content. This is not intended for commercial use or bypassing paywalls.

## Your Responsibility

You are solely responsible for testing, customizing, and using these filters. If something breaks, feel free to fork and fix it yourself – that's the beauty of open source.
