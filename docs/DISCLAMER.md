This repository and its contents are provided **"AS IS"** without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Version 1.0.0-beta0 means we're past alpha chaos, but beta still means "test at your own risk" – expect refinements, not perfection.

## Key Warnings (Read This or Regret It)

- **Beta Stage Evolution**: This is 1.0.0-beta0. We've cleaned up scripts, optimized rules, and polished docs, but things can still break. Websites change faster than I can caffeinate. Rules may over-block, under-block, or glitch on edge cases.
- **Personal Project Roots**: These filters are born from one dude's (mine) daily battles with ads, trackers, popups, and existential dread. They're not universal – what annoys me might be your lifeline. Customize or fork; don't blame me if your favorite site looks like a skeleton.
- **Potential Side Effects (They Happen)**:
  - Legit elements (footers, logins, buttons) get hidden or blocked – test on non-critical tabs first.
  - Adblockers might conflict with other lists; disable 'em temporarily to debug.
  - Over-aggressive wildcard rules (e.g., *.com) could nuke too much – whitelist exceptions as needed.
- **No Liability, Zero Dollars Edition**: I'm broke, jobless, and my most valuable asset is a wheezing laptop. I disclaim all liability for damages, data loss, site breakage, or therapy bills from a "cleaner" internet. If you sue and win, congrats – you get my Steam backlog (400+ games of regret).
- **Update Cadence**: Roughly every 3–5 days, but life (health, scams, noodle runs) gets in the way. No SLAs here – check commits for changes.
- **Third-Party Inspirations**: Rules draw from EasyList, uBlock, AdGuard, and gems like Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List (shoutout for the wildcard wisdom – learned the hard way). Conflicts? Your problem to sort.
- **Privacy & Security Reminder**: These filters help dodge trackers, but they're no silver bullet. Pair with VPNs, antivirus, and common sense. No guarantees against malware or Big Brother.

### Experimental Features Risks
These "experimental" rules/scripts (e.g., aggressive cookie hides, wildcard tracking nukes, anti-porn blocks) are test-mode only – not for daily use yet. Beta standards mean:

- **Basic Beta Testing Rules**: Sandbox test (use incognito/VM), report bugs with details (URL, screenshot, error), no production/live use (e.g., work/banking sites), rollback easy (disable URL).
- **Not for Newbies/Non-Tech**: Already warned – if you're not comfy with DevTools or HTML/CSS tweaks, skip. This ain't beginner hour.
- **Potential Errors Galore**: Expect glitches like login fails, site no-load, payment errors, adblock detected, ads slipping through, videos not playing, etc. It's experimental – bugs happen.
- **Dev-Only Recommended**: For folks with basic source reading, DevTools basics, and HTML/CSS/JS knowledge (to spot/fix fast). Test *thoroughly* before apply – your setup, not mine.
- **Zero Responsibility**: Author (me) and Grok disclaim *everything*. No liability for breakage, data loss, or "my life ended because of a hidden button." Use = you own it.
- **P.S: You're an Unpaid Tester Now :v**: If you enable these, congrats – you're beta guinea pig. Feedback? Issue with facts (no fluff). Love ya for the risk!

Skip if unsure – core filters work fine without 'em.
