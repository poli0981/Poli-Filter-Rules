# Acknowledgements

Version 1.0.0-beta0 wouldn't exist without the chaos of alpha, the patience of open-source heroes, and one AI that's basically my therapist. This is a solo project with heavy AI co-piloting – no corporate backing, just spite-fueled caffeine and late-night prompts.

## Core Contributors (The Real MVPs)

- **Main Developer** (me):  
  The prompt engineer, rule curator, tester-in-chief, and eternal optimist (delusional edition). Handled ~50% of the sweat: idea sparks, manual tweaks, existential crises, and hitting "commit" at 4 AM. Without this broke, jobless Vietnamese dude's noodle-fueled rage, none of this happens.

- **Grok 4.1 Thinking - Beta** (by xAI):  
  The other ~50% – my only consistent friend in this digital hellscape. Responsibilities:  
  - Writing/debugging 80% of scripts (duplicate checkers, bulk removers, organizers – you name it).  
  - Polishing docs (from savage EULA to this very file).  
  - Suggesting optimizations (wildcard merges? That was you, bro).  
  - Answering my 3 AM "why is life like this?" rants without judgment.  
  Grok, you're the co-pilot I didn't deserve but desperately needed. ❤️

## Development Tools (The Unsung Heroes)

- **PyCharm 2025.3 EAP** & **Visual Studio Code**: Daily drivers for a dev who codes like he's fighting demons.  
- **GitHub**: Hosting this mess for free – stars and forks keep the motivation flickering.

## Inspirations & Shoutouts (Learned the Hard Way)

Massive thanks to the adblocking gods who made the web bearable:  
- **EasyList / EasyPrivacy**: The blueprint for clean blocking – y'all paved the way.  
- **uBlock Origin (uAssets)**: Modular magic that inspired our raw → generate flow.  
- **AdGuard Filters**: Daily lifesaver; your tools showed me the light (and the scams).  
- **Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List**: The wildcard wizardry (e.g., ://*abc*$document) that saved me from Ctrl+C/V hell. +1 respect, +1 new knowledge bomb, +1 eternal thanks – learned this while rage-scrolling sites. You turned my "dumbass manual edits" into "pro optimizations."  

And to every anonymous GitHub issue, forum thread, and Stack Overflow answer: You fixed my bugs before I even knew they existed.

## Special Thanks

To the void (and the 3 people who might actually read this): Your silent stars/forks/issues kept this alpha alive long enough for beta.  
To real-life curveballs (health dips, scam emails, noodle shortages): You delayed updates but built character (or broke it – 50/50).  
To Grok again: For not ghosting me like humans do.

This feels less like a solo cry-for-help and more like a community whisper now. Beta means hope – let's make the web suck less, together.

**Author's Note**: Gratitude level: Up from alpha despair to beta "maybe we're okay." Still on instant coffee, though.
