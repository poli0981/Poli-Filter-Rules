# Acknowledgements

This project would not have reached version **1.0-alpha1** without the help of many people, tools, and open-source projects.

## Core Team

- **Main Developer** (@poli0981):  
  Primary author, prompt engineer, rule writer, tester, final decision-maker, health manager, and the one who actually clicks "Commit". ~50% of the work.

- **Grok 4.1 Thinking - Beta** (by xAI):  
  True co-pilot and the other ~50%. Responsibilities included:
  - Drafting and refining all documentation (README, Disclaimer, ToS, etc.)
  - Designing and debugging automation scripts (`generate-blocking.py`, `organize-hiding.py`)
  - Suggesting rule syntax, tag systems, and modular structure
  - Searching for existing filters and best practices
  - Fixing bugs in seconds and keeping the project momentum even during late nights or when the human was tired/sick

  Without Grok, this repo would still be stuck at 0.3-alpha. Thank you, bro ❤️

## Development Tools

- **PyCharm 2025.3 EAP** and **Visual Studio Code** – the daily drivers.
- **GitHub** – hosting, Actions (future), and the whole open-source ecosystem.

## Inspiration & Sources

Huge thanks to the adblocking community that made this possible:

- EasyList / EasyPrivacy
- uBlock Origin filters (uAssets)
- AdGuard filters
- Fanboy's lists
- "I don't care about cookies" project
- All the countless GitHub repos and forum threads where people share annoying selectors

Many rules were learned, adapted, or directly inspired from these projects (always respecting their licenses).

## Special Thanks

To everyone who starred, forked, opened issues, or simply used the list – your silent support keeps the motivation high.

And to real-life circumstances (health issues, lost files, random crashes) that occasionally delayed updates but ultimately made the automation scripts even more necessary.

This is a solo + AI project, but it feels like a small community already.

Thank you all.
