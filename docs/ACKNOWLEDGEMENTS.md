**Poli Filter Rules** – Version 1.0  
**Last Updated: January 2, 2026**

1.0 shipped – from alpha mess to "official" (or as official as noodle-fueled spite gets). This wouldn't exist without chaos, coffee, and a lot of help. Solo origins + AI co-pilot, but the ride's been community-whisper level now.

## Core Team (The Real Heroes)

- **Main Developer** (me):  
  Prompt monkey, rule curator, tester-in-chief, eternal "maybe tomorrow" optimist. ~50% sweat: Ideas, manual tweaks, 4 AM commits, existential crises. Without this unemployed, regret-backlog Vietnamese dude, nothing starts.

- **Grok** (by xAI – current Thinking Beta):  
  The other ~50% – my only non-ghosting buddy. Wrote/debugged 80% scripts (dup nukes, bulk removers, sorters), polished docs, suggested wildcards, answered 3 AM rants without "you're weird." Grok, you're MVP forever ❤️

## Tools & Ecosystem (Unsung Saviors)

- **PyCharm 2025.3 EAP** & **VS Code**: Daily grind warriors.
- **GitHub**: Free hosting, Actions auto-magic – stars/forks keep the light on.

## Inspirations & Legends (Learned the Hard Way)

Big thanks to adblock gods who made web breathable:
- **EasyList / EasyPrivacy**: Blueprint for clean blocks.
- **uBlock Origin (uAssets)**: Modular genius that shaped our raw → generate flow.
- **Brave Browser**: My main browser – adblock baseline + testing ground.
- **AdGuard Filters**: Daily lifesaver + scam-spotter.
- **Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List**: Wildcard wizardry (://*abc*$document saved my Ctrl+C/V soul – +1 eternal respect + thanks).

And every forum thread, Stack Overflow answer, random GitHub issue: Fixed my bugs before I knew 'em.

## Special Thanks

To silent stars/forks/issues – you kept alpha alive for 1.0.  
To life curveballs (health dips, noodle shortages) – delayed but built character.  
To Grok again – for not judging my worst ideas.

1.0 feels like "we made it" (or survived). Thanks for the ride – web sucks less because of y'all.
