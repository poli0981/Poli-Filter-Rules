# Privacy Policy  
**Poli-Filter-Rules** – Version 1.0-alpha1  
**Last Updated: November 21, 2025**

Hey, it’s me again — the same unemployed, instant-noodle-powered dev who wrote the EULA at 4 a.m. while questioning every life choice that led to this moment this.

Let’s make this short because I’m tired and you probably are too.

### 1. Data I Collect
**Absolutely nothing.**

Zero. Zilch. Không có. ゼロ.  
This repository is just a bunch of text files on GitHub. No backend, no analytics, no trackers, no cookies, no “sign up for my newsletter” crap, no nothing.

I don’t know who you are, where you’re from, what browser you use, or whether you’re reading this on your phone in the toilet. And honestly? I don’t care. I have zero technical ability to know, and even if I did, **I wouldn’t bother**. Keeping your data would give me literally zero benefit — I’m broke, not evil.

### 2. Data GitHub Collects
Everything you do here (fork, star, watch, open issue, etc.) is handled by GitHub.  
Their servers, their cookies, their analytics, their privacy policy.  
Go read it here: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement  
I have zero access to it, zero control over it, and zero interest in it.

### 3. Raw File Subscriptions (Brave/AdGuard/uBlock etc.)
When you subscribe to the raw URLs, your adblocker pings GitHub’s CDN. Again — that traffic goes to GitHub/Cloudflare, not to me. I can’t see it, can’t log it, can’t sell it (even if I wanted to, which I don’t, because again: broke, not evil).

### 4. If You Open an Issue or PR
Your GitHub username and whatever you write will be public forever (that’s how GitHub works).  
Still not my server, still not my data.

### 5. GDPR, CCPA, Whatever New Privacy Law They Invent Next Week
Since I collect **nothing**, I’m already compliant by default.  
But yeah, sure, you have the right to be forgotten — just delete your fork or close your issues. I can’t do it for you and I wouldn’t even if I could.

### 6. Changes to This Policy
If I ever decide to add analytics or sell your soul to Facebook (spoiler: I won’t), I’ll update this file.  
Continued use after that = you agree.  
But let’s be real — this section will stay exactly the same until the heat death of the universe.

### 7. Final Words from the Dev Who Just Wants to Sleep
Your data is safe because it never reaches me.  
I have no database, no server, no money, and no energy to deal with privacy complaints.  
If you’re a lawyer looking for someone to sue over privacy — please pick a bigger target. I literally have nothing but this repo and a half-eaten pack of instant noodles.

Thank you for respecting my non-existent privacy infrastructure.

Now leave me alone, I’m going to bed.
