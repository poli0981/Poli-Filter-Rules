# Privacy Policy  
**Poli-Filter-Rules** – Version 1.0-alpha1  
**Last Updated: November 22, 2025**

### English Version

### 1. Data Collection?
   Zero. Nada. Không có. Zilch. Null. None.  
   This repo is just a bunch of text files on GitHub.  
   I don't have servers, I don't have analytics, I don't have cookies, I don't even have a proper job.

### 2. So what do I know about you?  
   Literally nothing.  
   GitHub might know your IP when you download the raw file – that's between you and Microsoft.

   I don't see shit. I don't want to see shit. I have enough problems with my own life.

### 3. **Nah, your data – what do I get from keeping it?**  
   Exactly fucking nothing. Not a single đồng. Not even a view on YouTube.  
   I'm too broke and too lazy to sell your data even if I had it (which I don't).

### 4. **Raw File Subscriptions (Brave/AdGuard/uBlock etc.)**
   When you subscribe to the raw URLs, your adblocker pings GitHub’s CDN. Again — that traffic goes to GitHub/Cloudflare, not to me. I can’t see it, can’t log it, can’t sell it (even if I wanted to, which I don’t, because again: broke, not evil).

### 5. **Third-party stuff**  
   If you subscribe via raw URL → Cloudflare/GitHub CDN sees your request. Again, not my circus, not my monkeys.

### 6. If You Open an Issue or PR
Your GitHub username and whatever you write will be public forever (that’s how GitHub works).  
Still not my server, still not my data.

### 7. **Future plans**  
   Even if one day this repo blows up to 10k stars (lmao in my dreams), I still won't add analytics.  
   Because:
   - I hate trackers myself (that's why I made this repo)
   - I'm too depressed to learn how to implement them properly
   - My laptop would probably explode

### 8. Changes to This Policy
If I ever decide to add analytics or sell your soul to Facebook (spoiler: I won’t), I’ll update this file.  
Continued use after that = you agree.  
But let’s be real — this section will stay exactly the same until the heat death of the universe.

### 9. **Your responsibility**  
   If you're in EU and worried about GDPR – congrats, you're the first person ever to read this far.  
   Since I collect zero data, you're already compliant by default. You're welcome.

Still reading? Go touch some grass, king.
