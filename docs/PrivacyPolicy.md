# Privacy Policy

**Poli-Filter-Rules** – Version 1.0.0-beta0  
**Last Updated: November 26, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains (or tries to) how this repo handles your data. Spoiler: It doesn't. At all. Beta means we've tidied up the edges, but the core truth remains – this is static text files on GitHub, not a data-hoarding empire.

We're compliant with general principles (GDPR-inspired for open-source vibes), but since there's zero collection, you're golden by default.

## 1. Data Collection (The Short Answer: None)

- **Zero Personal Data**: No tracking, no IPs, no emails, no "tell me your life story" forms. This repo is dumb text: filters, scripts, docs. No servers, no analytics, no creepy cookies.
- **What I Know About You**: Nothing. Zilch. GitHub might log your download (their policy, not mine – check https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement). I see stars/forks/issues, but that's public repo magic.
- **Scripts & Tools**: Beta cleaners (duplicate checkers, bulk removers) run locally on your machine – they touch zero data beyond your raw files. No phoning home.

## 2. Data Use & Sharing (Even Shorter: Nope)

- No collection = no use, no sharing, no selling. I'm too broke and lazy for that game (plus, I hate trackers – irony?).
- Contributions (PRs/issues): Your GitHub username goes public. That's it. No emails harvested.

## 3. Third-Party Links & Tools (Not My Mess)

- Raw URLs hit GitHub/CDN – their privacy rules apply (read 'em if paranoid).
- Inspirations like EasyList/uBlock/AdGuard: External, their policies separate. We adapt rules, not data.

## 4. Beta Changes & Future (Spoiler: Still Zero)

- Beta optimizations (wildcard merges, script polish) don't touch data – just cleaner code.
- If the repo explodes (lmao), still no analytics. Promise. My laptop would melt first.

## 5. Your Rights & Contact (Do What You Want)

- EU folks: GDPR? You're set – no data means no requests needed.
- Questions? Open an issue (Wiki/FAQ first, or gentle RTFM). Or email [lopop05905@proton.me] – I'll see it in a week (if it's not a scam).

This policy might evolve (beta's all about iteration). Check back, or don't – your data's safe either way.

Thanks for trusting this noodle-fueled project. Make the web private(ish).
