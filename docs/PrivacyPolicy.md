# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how the Custom Adblock Filter List project ("Project") handles your information. As an open-source GitHub repository licensed under MIT, the Project does not collect, store, or process any personal data. This policy is designed to be transparent and compliant with general privacy principles (e.g., GDPR-inspired for open-source projects).

## 1. Data Collection
- **No Personal Data Collected**: The Project is a static collection of filter rules hosted on GitHub. We do not track users, collect IP addresses, emails, or any personally identifiable information (PII).
- **No Cookies or Tracking**: There are no scripts, analytics, or third-party services embedded in the Project that could collect data.
- **GitHub Interactions**: Any data you provide to GitHub (e.g., when forking, starring, or opening issues) is governed by GitHub's Privacy Statement (available at https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement). We have no access to or control over that data.

## 2. Data Use and Sharing
- Since no data is collected, there is no use, sharing, or processing of personal information.
- If you contribute to the Project (e.g., via pull requests), your GitHub username and contributions may be publicly visible, as per GitHub's terms.

## 3. Third-Party Links
- The Project may reference external filter lists or tools (e.g., EasyList). Their privacy practices are separate; review them independently.

## 4. Changes to This Policy
- We may update this policy occasionally. Changes will be posted in the repository with the updated date.
- Continued use of the Project after changes implies acceptance.

## 5. Contact
If you have questions, open an issue on the GitHub repository.
