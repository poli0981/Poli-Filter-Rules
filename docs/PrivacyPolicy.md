**Poli Filter Rules** – Version 1.0  
**Last Updated: January 2, 2026**

Short version: I collect nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada. 1.0 means polished docs, but the core truth stays – this is static text files + local scripts on GitHub, not a data vampire.

Compliant with basics (GDPR vibes for open-source), but zero collection = you're safe by default. No tricks.

## 1. Data Collection (None – Seriously)

- **Personal Data? Nope**: No tracking, IPs, emails, forms. Repo = text (filters, scripts, docs). No servers, analytics, cookies – my laptop barely runs this.
- **What I See**: Stars/forks/issues (public GitHub). Downloads? GitHub logs (their policy – https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement). I see nothing.
- **Scripts Local**: Beta/1.0 tools (dup checkers, param extractors) run on *your* machine – touch your files only. No phone-home.

## 2. Use & Sharing (Still None)

- No data = no use/sharing/selling. Too broke/lazy for that (and I hate trackers – irony).
- PRs/Issues: GitHub username public. That's it.

## 3. Third-Party (Not My Problem)

- Raw URLs → GitHub/CDN (their privacy).
- Inspirations (EasyList/uBlock/AdGuard/Dandelion Sprout): External – their rules.

## 4. 1.0 Changes & Future (Guess What – Still Zero)

- 1.0 polish (auto-updates ~3 days via Action, modular files) touches no data.
- Future? Extensions/apps? Still local/zero collection promise. Laptop melt before analytics.

## 5. Your Rights & Contact (Easy)

- GDPR/CCPA? Zero data = compliant default. Requests? Unneeded, but issue/email if paranoid.
- Questions? Issue (Wiki/FAQ first) or [your.email@gmail.com] – reply when coffee hits.

Policy evolves (1.0 iterative). Check back, or don't – data safe anyway.

Thanks for trusting noodle project. Web private(ish) now.

– The dev who collects regrets, not data :v (1.0 shipped – still tired)
