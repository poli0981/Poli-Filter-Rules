# Terms of Service (ToS)

**Poli-Filter-Rules** – Version 1.0.0-beta0.6125  

By accessing, downloading, using, forking, starring, or lurking around this repo, you agree to these Terms of Service. No "oops, missed that" – it's concise, it's binding (as much as a solo dev's noodle budget allows), and it's here to keep things drama-free. Beta means we've leveled up from alpha mess, but it's still "test responsibly" territory.

These ToS, plus the MIT License, EULA, Privacy Policy, and Disclaimer, form the full agreement. If you don't vibe with it, close the tab and embrace the ads – your call.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms (The "You Clicked It" Clause)

Your use means you accept these ToS, MIT rules, and all linked docs. Beta upgrades (optimized wildcards, duplicate cleaners) come with the same "as is" spirit – no hidden gotchas, but test 'em yourself.

## 2. Description of Service (What You're Getting)

Text files, scripts, and rules to nuke ads, trackers, popups, and annoyances. Beta polish: Cleaner merges (e.g., blah.co.com → ||co.com^$all), smarter hiding (no more *##.footer noobery), and tools like bulk removers. Updates ~every 3–5 days (or when life/coffee allows). No guarantees on perfection – websites evolve faster than my regrets.

## 3. User Responsibilities (Your Side of the Deal)

You agree to:
- Not be toxic (no hate, no spam – read Code of Conduct or get blocked; I've had enough IRL).
- Stay legal: No illegal paywall bypasses, piracy, or harm (local laws like GDPR? Your homework).
- Test thoroughly: Beta scripts (duplicate checkers, wildcard nukes) are powerful – sandbox 'em, whitelist if needed.
- Credit if forking: MIT says yes, but a nod back keeps karma positive.

## 4. Prohibited Activities (Don't Do These, Seriously)

Thou shalt not:
- Spam issues/discussions with "fix plz" sans details (URL, selector, screenshot – or RTFM).
- Commercialize without MIT compliance (sell it? Cool, but don't ghost the credit).
- Dox, harass, or sue (I'm broke – you'd win a high-five and my Steam backlog).
- Blame me for breakage (site down? Fork and fix – open-source 101).

## 5. Intellectual Property (It's MIT, Chill)

All content MIT-licensed: Fork, tweak, ship. Scripts (bulk removers, cleaners) included. No trademarks claimed – it's humble text + Python.

## 6. Limitation of Liability (The "Not My Circus" Section)

To the max allowed by law (Vietnam's, since that's my chaos zone): No liability for anything. Not breakage, not lost data, not "my ad-free Netflix glitched mid-binge." Beta optimizations help, but if wildcards nuke too much, that's user error (kinda). Suing? Good luck – my assets are instant noodles and regrets.

## 7. Termination (The Breakup)

Violate? Access ends. I can nuke your fork/PR anytime (rudeness, spam, bad vibes). You can bail anytime – delete and ghost.

## 8. Governing Law (Jurisdiction Drama)

Vietnam laws apply. International? Fly over and serve papers – I'll wave from my wheezing laptop.

## 9. Changes to ToS (The "Life Evolves" Bit)

I can tweak anytime (beta's all about iteration). Continued use = acceptance. Check the file for updates.

## 10. Severability & Entire Agreement (Legal Jargon Bingo)

Invalid clause? Rest stands. This + MIT/EULA/Privacy/Disclaimer = full deal. No side chats.

Beta's our glow-up – thanks for riding along. Make the web better (or break it trying). Questions? Issues open, Wiki first.

– The dev who's almost proud (one coffee from calling it "stable")

## Special: Experimental Features Warning (Beta Tester Only)

- **Basic Beta Testing Rules**: Sandbox test (use incognito/VM), report bugs with details (URL, screenshot, error), no production/live use (e.g., work/banking sites), rollback easy (disable URL).
- **Potential Errors Galore**: Expect glitches like login fails, site no-load, payment errors, adblock detected, ads slipping through, videos not playing, etc. It's experimental – bugs happen.
- **Zero Responsibility**: Author (me) and Grok disclaim *everything*. No liability for breakage, data loss, or "my life ended because of a hidden button." Use = you own it.
- **P.S: You're an Unpaid Tester Now :v**: If you enable these, congrats – you're beta guinea pig. Feedback? Issue with facts (no fluff). Love ya for the risk!
