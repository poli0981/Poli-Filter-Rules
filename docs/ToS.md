# Terms of Service (ToS)

**Poli Filter Rules** – Version 1.0  
**Last Updated: January 2, 2026**

By accessing, downloading, using, forking, starring, or even lurking this repo, you agree to these Terms. No "didn't read" excuses – it's short, real, and binding (as much as a broke dev's word can be). 1.0 means we've survived to "official," but it's still "use at your own risk" – auto-updates every ~3 days via GitHub Actions (rules fresh, but test 'em).

These ToS + MIT License + EULA + Privacy Policy + Disclaimer = full deal. Don't vibe? Close tab, embrace ads – your choice.

## 1. Acceptance (You Clicked It)

Use = accept all docs. Beta's gone – 1.0's here with polished scripts (auto-sort/count every 3 days), modular files, and experimental toys. No hidden tricks.

## 2. Service Description (What You Get)

Text files, scripts, rules to nuke ads/trackers/popups. 1.0 polish: Leaner wildcards, dup-free raws, cookie/third-party modules. Updates ~3–5 days (or when life allows). No uptime/SLA – open-source vibes.

## 3. User Responsibilities (Your Part)

- Not toxic (CoC applies – trash me/project OK, others no).
- Legal stuff yours (GDPR/CCPA/local laws? Figure it – no data collected here, but your use = your compliance :v).
- Test changes (scripts powerful – sandbox first).
- Credit MIT-style if redistributing.

## 4. Prohibited Stuff (Don't Do This)

- Spam/issues off-topic (Wiki/FAQ first or RTFM :v).
- Illegal use (paywall bypass, harm – not my circus).
- Sue/harass (I'm broke – win my noodle collection).
- Blame breakage (over-block? Whitelist – your setup).

## 5. IP (MIT, Chill)

All MIT – fork/tweak/ship. Scripts included. No trademarks.

## 6. Liability Limit (Not My Problem Edition)

Max law allows (Vietnam's, my chaos zone): No liability. Not breakage, not data loss, not "therapy from cleaner web." GDPR/CCPA? Zero collection = compliant default, but your laws = your problem :v. Auto-updates fresh – glitches? Test.

## 7. Termination (Easy Out)

Violate? Access ends. I can nuke PR/issues. You bail anytime – delete & ghost.

## 8. Governing Law (Drama Zone)

Vietnam laws. International? Good luck serving papers to noodle guy.

## 9. Changes (Life Evolves)

Tweak anytime (1.0 iterative). Use after = accept. Check file.

## 10. Severability & Full Deal

Invalid part? Rest stands. This + other docs = everything.

1.0's our milestone – thanks for riding. Make web suck less.

– The dev one coffee from "stable" (don't hold breath :v)
