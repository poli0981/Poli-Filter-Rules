# Terms of Service (ToS)  
**Custom Adblock Filter List** – Version 1.0-alpha1  
**Last Updated: November 21, 2025**

Hello again. It’s me — the same unemployed dev who just died for the 47th time to Malenia in Elden Ring NG+2, screamed into the void, closed the game, opened this repo, and decided to finish the legal docs while my poor 3-year-old laptop is begging for mercy with its fan sounding like a jet engine.

Yes, I’m still jobless. Yes, I’m still surviving on instant noodles and copium. Yes, if you want to watch me get absolutely destroyed by a naked lady with a katana, feel free to check my Steam profile or YouTube channel (links will be in CONTACT.md whenever I remember to create it).

Now, let’s get this over with.

### 1. Acceptance of Terms
By using, viewing, forking, starring, or even breathing in the general direction of this repository, you agree to these Terms of Service, the MIT License, the EULA I wrote while crying, and the Privacy Policy I wrote while half-asleep.

Don’t like it? Close the tab. Go play Elden Ring yourself. I hear Malenia is feeling generous today.

### 2. Use of Service
You may use this filter list for any purpose allowed under the MIT License — personal, commercial, world domination, whatever.  
You may NOT:
- Blame me when a site breaks
- Blame me when your company’s internal dashboard disappears because you applied my aggressive rules
- Blame me when your mom can’t see cat videos on Facebook because I nuked all FB widgets
- Sue me (please, I’m begging you, I have nothing but debt and 400 hours+ in Elden Ring)

### 3. Prohibited Activities
Don’t be a dick. Specifically:
- Don’t use this list to break laws (bypassing paywalls in countries where it’s illegal, etc.)
- Don’t rehost my files and pretend you made them
- Don’t send me job offers that pay in “exposure”
- Don’t send me death threats when a rule hides your favorite waifu banner

### 4. Updates & Availability
The list is updated every 3–5 days when I’m not:
- Rage-quitting Elden Ring
- Applying for jobs and getting ghosted
- Staring at the ceiling wondering why I chose this life
- Sleeping (rare)

There is no guarantee of uptime, updates, or me not deleting the entire repo at 3 a.m. because I failed the same boss for the 100th time.

### 5. Termination
I can terminate your access (i.e., delete the repo or block you) anytime, for any reason, or no reason at all.  
Probably because I died to Malenia again and needed to take it out on someone.

### 6. Limitation of Liability Indemnification (copy-paste from EULA because I’m tired)
Same as EULA. No liability. Zero. None.  
You break it, you buy it. You get fired because of it, you explain it.  
If someone sues because of your use of this list → you pay the lawyers, not me.

### 7. Governing Law
Laws of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, because that’s where this broke dev is currently losing his mind to a FromSoftware game.

### 8. Final Words from the Dev Who Should Be Sleeping
Look, I made this list so I could browse the web without wanting to throw my laptop out the window.  
If it helps you → awesome, buy me a coffee or just star the repo.  
If it breaks your entire internet experience → fork it and fix it, or uninstall.  
If you’re here to complain → please don’t. My mental health is held together by duct tape and Elden Ring copium.

Now if you’ll excuse me, my laptop is literally crying (fan noise = tears), and I’m going to attempt Malenia one more time before passing out.

Try not to miss.
