# Terms of Service (ToS)  
**Poli-Filter-Rules** – Version 1.0-alpha1  
**Last Updated: November 22, 2025**

### English Version (the one that will actually hold up if someone tries to sue my broke ass)

By accessing, downloading, forking, starring, watching, opening an issue, or even breathing in the general direction of this repository, you unconditionally agree to these Terms of Service.  
No backsies. No “I didn’t read”. No refunds (it’s free anyway).

1. **Acceptance of Terms**  
   You accept these ToS, the MIT License, the EULA I just wrote while half-dead, the Privacy Policy (which is basically “I collect nothing”), and the Disclaimer (which says everything will probably break).  
   If you don’t accept → close the tab right now and go back to suffering with cookie banners. Your loss.

2. **Description of Service**  
   I give you text files that (try to) kill ads, trackers, popups, chatbots, and anything else that personally triggering me on the internet.  
   That’s it. No support. No uptime guarantee. No “it just works”.

3. **User Responsibilities – listen up, this is important**  
   You agree to:
   - Not be a dick.
   - Not use these filters to break laws (e.g. g. bypassing paywalls illegally, piracy, harassment, etc.).
   - Not redistribute modified versions and pretend it’s official without clearly saying it’s your fork.
   - Not blame me when a site detects your adblocker and calls you poor (they’re not wrong).
   - Test everything yourself. I’m not your filter list, not your mom.

4. **Prohibited Activities – don’t make me add more rules**  
   You shall NOT:
   - Use this repo for commercial products without at least buying me a coffee (kidding, but also not really).
   - Spam issues with “it doesn’t work on this site fix plz” without providing the URL and selector (I’m tired, bro).
   - Sue me, threaten me, dox me, or send me hate mail. I’m already depressed enough.
   - Hold me responsible if your favourite site breaks. Fork it and fix it yourself – that’s literally the point of open source.

5. **Intellectual Property**  
   The filters are MIT-licensed. You can do almost anything.  
   But if you make money off my suffering and don’t at least star the repo… man, that’s cold.

6. **Limitation of Liability – the “I told you so” section**  
   To the maximum extent permitted by law (which in my case is basically everything because I have nothing to lose):  
   I am not liable for anything. Ever.  
   Not for broken websites, not for lost data, not for emotional trauma from seeing how many trackers Facebook has, not for your boss noticing you’re suddenly too productive at work.  
   If the repo disappears tomorrow because I got bored or my laptop finally committed suicide – tough luck.

7. **Termination**  
   I can ban you from the repo any time for any reason.  
   Reasons may include: being rude, spamming, or simply because I woke up in a bad mood.  
   You can stop using the repo any time by… just stopping. No ceremony required.

8. **Governing Law & Jurisdiction**  
   Laws of Vietnam.  
   Good luck flying here to serve papers on a guy who can’t even afford instant noodles this week.

9. **Changes to Terms**  
   I can change these ToS whenever I want.  
   If you keep using the repo after changes → you accept them.  
   I’ll probably update the date and that’s it.

10. **Severability**  
    If any part of these terms is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the rest still apply.  
    I still hate popups.

11. **Entire Agreement**  
    This, plus the MIT License, EULA, Privacy Policy, and Disclaimer, is the whole deal.  
    No verbal agreements. No “but you said on Discord…”. Nothing.

Still reading?  
Respect.  
Now go use the filters and let me sleep.
