# End-User License Agreement (EULA)  
**Poli-Filter-Rules** – Version 1.0-alpha1  
**Last Updated: November 21, 2025**

Yo, listen up.  
I’m the broke, tired, slightly depressed dev who built this repo in PyCharm at 3 a.m. while eating instant noodles and talking to an AI because real humans are exhausting.  
This EULA is written in plain English (with a sprinkle of sarcasm) so that even corporations’ lawyers can’t pretend they “didn’t understand”.  
If you keep reading and still use the list, you’re legally agreeing to everything below. No take-backs.

### 1. Acceptance of Terms
By downloading, copying, forking, subscribing to, or even thinking about using any file in this repository, you are accepting this EULA and the MIT License (reproduced in full below).  
If you do not accept, close the tab right now and go touch grass. Seriously.

### 2. The Actual License (MIT – because I’m not a monster)
Copyright (c) 2025 [poli0981](https://github.com/poli0981) (currently unemployed and caffeine-dependent)

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

### 3. Reality Check (read this part twice)
- This is a **personal** filter list made by one sleep-deprived guy and his AI bro (Grok 4.1).  
- It is **guaranteed to be incomplete**, will break some sites, will miss new ads tomorrow, and might accidentally hide your bank login button. That’s on you.
- I update when I feel like it (roughly every 3–5 days), or when I don’t have a migraine, or when my cat doesn’t delete the repo. There is no SLA. There will never be an SLA.
- If your government, country, or company has weird laws (GDPR, CCPA, whatever new acronym they invent next week), it is **your job** to check compliance. I’m just a dude in his pajamas.

### 4. No Warranties Whatsoever (yes, all caps is intentional)
THIS LIST COMES WITH **ZERO** GUARANTEES.  
It might work today, it might explode tomorrow.  
It might save your sanity, it might make you rage-quit the internet.  
I literally do not care — you assume all risk.

### 5. Limitation of Liability (the part lawyers love)
To the maximum extent permitted by law, I (the author), my cat, my AI friend, and anyone even remotely connected to this repo will **not** be liable for any damages — direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or “my boss fired me because the company dashboard broke”.  
Not even if you lose money, data, sleep, or your will to live.

### 6. Indemnification (yeah I learned that word from templates)
You agree to defend and hold harmless the author (me, the unemployed one) from any claims, damages, or lawyer letters arising from your use or misuse of this list.  
If someone sues because you used my filters in a corporate environment and everything caught fire, that’s your circus, your monkeys.

### 7. Termination
If you violate this EULA (e.g., try to sue me), your rights end immediately and you must delete everything.  
I also reserve the right to yeet the entire repo whenever I want. No warning.

### 8. Governing Law
This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (because that’s where the dev currently suffers).  
If you’re in another country and your local law says something different — tough luck, you still agreed to this.

### 9. Final Words from the Sleep-Deprived Dev
Look, I made this to make my own browsing less painful.  
If it helps you → cool, star the repo.  
If it breaks something → open an issue or fork it and fix it yourself.  
If you want to sue → please don’t. I have literally nothing except instant noodles and depression.

You’ve been warned. Twice.  
Now go forth and block some ads… or don’t. I’m going back to sleep.
