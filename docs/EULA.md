# End-User License Agreement (EULA)  
**Poli-Filter-Rules** – Version 1.0-alpha1  
**Last Updated: November 22, 2025**

By downloading, copying, using, forking, starring, or even just looking at this repo for more than 5 seconds, you are agreeing to this EULA.  
Yes, seriously. No, I’m not kidding. Yes, even if you’re just “browsing”.

1. **Who the hell wrote this?**  
   A jobless, mildly depressed, socially awkward Vietnamese dude who dropped out of university, lives with his parents, has zero friends on Facebook, ~20 followers on X (most are bots), and a YouTube channel with 200 subs where 80% of the videos have <40 views and thumbnails that look like they were made in MS Paint 1998.  
   His only consistent friend is an AI (Grok 4.1 Thinking - Beta) because real humans are exhausting.  
   Right now, while writing this, his 3-year-old laptop is screaming like it’s about to explode, and he’s running on 3 hours of sleep and instant noodles.  
   So yeah… lower your expectations accordingly.

2. **The License – MIT, but make it personal**  
   The code/scripts/filters are under the standard MIT License (see LICENSE file).  
   You can use, modify, sell, tattoo it on your body – whatever. Just keep the copyright notice.  
   But let’s be real: this is a random dude’s hate-letter to annoying websites, written in fits of rage and caffeine.  
   It is provided **AS IS**, with **ZERO** warranties. If it breaks your browser, your PC catches fire, or your girlfriend leaves you because YouTube ads disappeared and she thinks you’re cheating with a cleaner internet – not my problem.

3. **No Liability – like, literally none**  
   I’m broke, unemployed, and my most valuable asset is a Steam library with 400+ games (half of them on sale for $2).  
   If you somehow manage to sue me and win, congratulations – you just won a half-eaten bag of chips and my eternal grudging respect.  
   I am not responsible for:
   - Websites breaking
   - Over-blocking (goodbye footers, login forms, and sometimes half the page)
   - Under-blocking (ads will still find a way, they always do)
   - Your government getting mad (GDPR, CCPA, whatever local law – that’s on YOU)
   - Emotional damage from realizing how dirty the internet actually is

4. **The filters will NEVER be perfect**  
   I’m average at best. I still need spirit summons to beat Elden Ring bosses on NG+2.  
   I use AI to write half this repo because my brain is fried.  
   Websites change every day. Rules will break. Deal with it or fork it and fix it yourself (please do, actually).

5. **Update Schedule? Lol.**  
   “Every 3–5 days” – narrated by a guy who sometimes disappears for two weeks because depression said hi or his laptop finally died.  
   No guarantees. No refunds (it’s free anyway).

6. **Governing Law**  
   Vietnam – because that’s where the broke author lives. Good luck enforcing anything internationally ☠

7. **Final Warning – read this is the important part**  
   If you use this list, you accept that:
   - You might have to fix stuff yourself
   - Things will break
   - I might abandon the repo tomorrow to go touch grass (unlikely) or play another 500 hours of random Steam games
   - You are solely responsible for complying with your local laws (GDPR and friends)

   **If you don’t agree – close the tab right now and go touch some ads.**

   Still here? Cool. Welcome to the 1% club. Enjoy the cleaner internet, fellow degenerate.
