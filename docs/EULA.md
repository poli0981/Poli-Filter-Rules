# End-User License Agreement (EULA)

**Poli-Filter-Rules** – Version 1.0.0-beta0  
**Last Updated: November 26, 2025**

By downloading, copying, using, forking, starring, or even glancing at this repo, you agree to this EULA. No "I didn't read it" excuses – it's short, it's real, and it's binding (or as binding as a broke dev's word can be).

This EULA governs the Software (filters, scripts, docs – the whole messy repo) under the MIT License. Beta means we've evolved from alpha dumpster fire, but it's still test-mode: Use wisely, or at your own risk.

## 1. License Grant (MIT, But Make It Personal)

The Software is licensed under MIT – permissive AF. You get free reign to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, sell, or tattoo it on your arm. Subject to:

- Keep the copyright notice in all copies (Copyright (c) 2025 poli0981 – yeah, that broke Vietnamese dev).
- Full MIT text (pasted below for convenience):

```text
MIT License
Copyright (c) 2025 poli0981
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:
The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.
```

Beta bonus: Scripts (duplicate checkers, bulk removers) are MIT too – fork 'em, but if you make bank, send a coffee (kidding... mostly).

## 2. Scope of Use (What You Can Do – And What You Probably Shouldn't)

- Personal or commercial? Go wild – as long as you follow MIT.
- No trademarks/patents claimed (it's text files, not rocket science).
- Beta caveat: Test on dummy setups first. Wildcard optimizations (e.g., `://*abc*$document`) are powerful but could nuke too much – whitelist as needed.

## 3. Limitations & Disclaimers (The "I Told You So" Fine Print)

- **AS IS, Beta Edition**: No warranties. Beta means polished alpha scars, but glitches lurk (site breakage, over-blocking, script quirks). If it bricks your browser or your coffee goes cold, that's on you.
- You're responsible for: Local laws (GDPR? CCPA? Figure it out), testing (don't blame me for a hidden login), and common sense (pair with VPNs for real privacy).
- No support SLA – updates every 3–5 days (or when life allows). Issues? Open one, but read Wiki/FAQ first or get gently RTFM'd.

## 4. Termination (The Easy Out)

Violate terms? License ends. Stop using, delete it, move on. I won't chase you (too tired).

## 5. Governing Law (Where the Drama Would Go Down)

Laws of Vietnam – because that's where this tired dev codes from a wheezing laptop. International enforcement? Good luck (and why bother?).

## 6. Final Plea (Read This Part)

This EULA exists to protect a solo dev's sanity, not to trap you. Customize, contribute, make it better. Beta's our shot at "good enough" – thanks for joining the ride.

Still here? You're a saint. Enjoy the cleaner web (or rage-quit when it breaks – your call).

– The dev who's one coffee away from calling this "stable" (don't hold your breath)
