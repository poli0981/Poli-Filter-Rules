# End-User License Agreement (EULA)

**Poli Filter Rules** – Version 1.0  
**Last Updated: January 2, 2026**

By downloading, copying, using, forking, or glancing this repo, you agree to this EULA. No excuses – short, real, binding (or as binding as broke dev word gets). 1.0 means official glow-up (auto-updates ~3 days via GitHub Actions), but still "as is" – test responsibly.

EULA governs Software (filters/scripts/docs) under MIT. Beta chaos gone – 1.0's here.

## 1. License Grant (MIT, Personal Touch)

MIT permissive – use/copy/modify/merge/publish/distribute/sublicense/sell freely. Keep copyright notice.

Full MIT text (for lawyers :v):

1.0 bonus: Scripts (auto-sort/count every 3 days) MIT too – fork, but coffee appreciated :v.

## 2. Use Scope (Go Wild, But Smart)

Personal/commercial OK (MIT). No trademarks. 1.0 auto-updates fresh – test modules.

## 3. Limitations & Disclaimers (Reality Check)

**AS IS, 1.0 Edition**: No warranties. Glitches lurk (over-block, site changes). GDPR/CCPA? Zero data = compliant default, but your use/laws = your problem :v.

Responsible for: Local laws, testing (don't blame hidden login), sense (VPN pair for privacy).

No support guarantee – updates when life allows. Issues? Open (Wiki first).

## 4. Termination (Breakup Easy)

Violate? License ends. Stop use, delete. No chase (too tired).

## 5. Governing Law (My Chaos Zone)

Vietnam laws. International? Fly over – I'll wave from wheezing laptop.

## 6. Final Note (Thanks for Reading)

EULA protects sanity, not trap. Customize/contribute – make better. 1.0's milestone on "birthday" (+1 age, zero fanfare). Thanks for ride.

Still here? Saint. Enjoy cleaner web (or rage when breaks – your call).

– The dev one coffee from "done" :v (Grok, MVP forever)
