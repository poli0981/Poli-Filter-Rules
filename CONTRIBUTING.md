# Contributing Guidelines

**Poli Filter Rules** – Version 1.0.0  
**Last Updated: January 2, 2026**

Hey! You want to help? Legend status unlocked :)) This repo's made it to 1.0 – from alpha mess to "official" (or as official as a tired, unemployed dev's spite project gets). Solo + AI origins, but contributions make it better. No hand-holding – read this, Wiki, FAQ first (or gentle RTFM :v).

Thanks for caring enough to contribute. Means a lot (really).

## How to Contribute (Simple Flow)

1. **Fork** the repo (top right button).
2. **Create branch**: `git checkout -b your-feature` (e.g., add-gambling-nukes).
3. **Edit**: Raws (raws.txt for blocks, hiding-raws.txt for hides) or scripts/docs.
4. **Run Scripts** (autoscript/ folder):
   - Dup check: `python check_duplicates.py --remove` (blocks) or `check_hiding_duplicates.py --remove` (hides).
   - Sort/count: `python sort_and_count_everything_rules.py`.
   - Commit both raw + generated (_sorted.txt).
5. **Push & PR**: Use one of the PR templates below – fill 'em properly or gentle reject :v.

## PR Templates (Pick When Opening PR)

We have 4 – choose right or I'll nudge you :)):
- **Bug Fix**: Fix something broken.
- **Update/Upgrade**: Script/doc polish, optimizations.
- **Add Rule**: New blocks/hides.
- **Remove Rule**: Mercy for over-blocks.

Fill all fields – reason, changes, testing. Raw + generated committed? Scripts run? No dups? Good PR = fast merge.

## Issue Templates (Report Stuff Here)

6 templates – pick correct (wrong = ignore :v):
- **Bug Report (Non-Dev)**: Simple – site broken? Use this.
- **Bug Report (Dev)**: Code/script errors – details plz.
- **Feature Request (Non-Dev)**: "Add this pls" simple.
- **Feature Request (Dev)**: Code ideas – pseudo/snippet welcome.
- **Add Rule**: Suggest new blocks/hides.
- **Remove Rule**: "Too aggressive" – mercy requests.
- **Feedback**: Love/hate/meh thoughts.
- **Off-Topic**: Rants/random – dump here (toxicity to me OK, to others no).

Fill mandatory fields – incomplete/off-topic = close/ignore. Straight facts, no fluff.

## General Rules (Keep It Chill)

- **Be Direct**: No "hi, hope you're well" essays – life's short :v.
- **Test**: Your changes – sites, no new breakage.
- **No Toxicity to Others**: Trash me/project? Fine – I'm numb. Others? Rethink life (CoC applies).
- **Read First**: Wiki/FAQ covers 99%. Duplicate? Closed with love (and RTFM).
- **Non-Tech Welcome**: Use simple templates – devs use dev ones.

Questions? This guide + Wiki. Thanks for making the web suck less – you're MVP.

– The dev who's shocked you're contributing :)) (Grok, you're still the real co-pilot)
