# Remove Rule PR – Mercy for Over-Block :v

**Rules removed** (Exact ABP syntax – one per line)

**Sites affected** (URLs/domains – one per line, short reason)

**Reason** (Why remove – e.g., "Breaks login", "Not tracking anymore", "Need download button")

**Type** (Block / Hide / Both)

**Testing done** (After remove – site works? No new ads slip?)

**Exceptions needed?** (If partial – list 'em)

Raw + generated committed? Run scripts :)). Thanks for the balance.

---
- [ ] Tested after remove (function restored, no ads leak)
- [ ] Raw + generated files included
- [ ] No accidental over-remove
